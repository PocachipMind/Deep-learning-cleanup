The book is an outgrowth\\nof the writer\\'s personal experience as an investment banker. Most of the\\nmatter which is presented has appeared in the pages of \"System\"\\nMagazine, through the courtesy of whose editors it is now rearranged and\\nconsolidated for publication in book form.'),\n",

A large part of the problem of investment lies\\nin the careful selection of securities to meet one's actual\\nrequirements. The average investor does not thoroughly understand this\\npoint. He does not realize that a high degree of one quality involves a\\nlower degree of other qualities. He may have a general impression that a\\nhigh rate of income is apt to indicate less assurance of safety, but he\\nrarely applies the same reasoning to other qualities. When he buys\\nsecurities, he is quite likely to pay for qualities which he does not\\nneed. It is very common, for example, when he wishes to make a permanent\\ninvestment and has no thought of reselling, to find him purchasing\\nsecurities which possess in a high degree the quality of convertibility.\")]"
